		<p style="color:#fff">Welcome to the Onion Kingdom! In Overcooked 2 you and up to 3 other fellow chefs embark on a cooking journey to save the kingdom from the monster breads...or the "unbread" in this delightfully whimsical if not challenging multi player game of culinary charm.</p>

<div class="paragraph_2">
		<p style="color:#fff">It is a fairly simple concept. You and fellow chefs must chop, cook, fry, build meals, and wash dishes as the orders build up. You are placed in kitchen "mazes" that vary in degrees of difficulty which make the progression of the game more and more challenging as time goes on. Infuriatingly so at times. You must communicate with yourt partner at all times in order to complete the levels. Just don't get too worked up with your partner or YOU might end up getting cooked!</p>

	<p class="p3" style="color:#fff">This game requires teamwork and communication to be able to successfully defeat your enemies. It can get a little intense at times but this is one of my favorite games to come along to the Switch for multi-player enjoyment in a while. Check out the gameplay to see Overwatch for Nintendo Switch in action.
