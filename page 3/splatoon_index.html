		<p style="color:white">Splatoon 2 is an action packed 3rd person "shooter" style game. Instead if guns, however, you and your team are armed with awesome weapons in the form of paint guns, paint rollers, paint bombs and other paint related weapons.</p>

<div class="paragraph_2">
		<p style="color:white">There is a storyline that you can follow but I honestly just like the online play. Here you can join with friends to form a team and dominate the landscape. The point of each level is to paint, well, everything. The floors, walls, objects. Everything! The team who covers the most area with their color paint wins!</p>

	<p class="p3" style="color:white">This game requires strategy to both paint the arenas and keep the opposing team away which adds up to hours of fun. Besides just free for all, which is my favorite, there are various capture the flag type games and others for a variety of gameplay.
